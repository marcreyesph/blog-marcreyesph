# Marc Reyes Blog

### A blog website by Marc Reyes

Marc is currently a Computer Science student, freelance web developer, and Machine Learning engineer in the making based in Cagayan de Oro. Experimenting new developer tools and studying Machine Learning are his new hobbies. He has already talked in many developer events and is enthusiastic in sharing what he learned.

Site is proudly made with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/marcreyesph/marcreyesph.github.io/), and deployed with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

### Setup

If you don't have `npm` and `gulp` installed in your system then you need to install them first before running. 

**Install npm**: `node` comes with `npm` installed so you should have a version of `npm`. However, `npm` gets updated more frequently than `node` does, so you'll want to make sure it's the latest version. 

**Install gulp**:  ```$ npm install -g gulp```

### Deployment
```bash
$ git clone --recursive git@github.com:/marcreyesph/marcreyesph.github.io
$ cd marcreyesph.github.io
$ npm install
$ gulp default
```
